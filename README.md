# Async Playground

This is purely a place for me to put code where I am experimenting with async
concepts in JavaScript. I make no promises that it will be well documented, but
hopefully there are some interesting things in here. Mostly it is a place for me
to store and share things I'm working out.

The async book mentioned is *Modern Asynchronous JavaScript* by Faraz K.
Kelhini.

The folder `simpson` is explorations I have made from lectures by Kyle Simpson.

Other code is my own attempts at implementing various async features such as
Promises and some of their methods. My promise implementation owes some of its
structure to Douglas Crockford's lectures. All of my implementations are naive
and not ready to be used in any sort of code. I focused on getting the
underlying concepts working to the point where I felt I understood them.
